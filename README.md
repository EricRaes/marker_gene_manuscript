Manuscript repository for: "Metabolic pathways inferred from a bacterial marker gene illuminate ecological changes across South Pacific frontal boundaries" Nature Communications

This repository contains the scripts and key datafiles used in our manuscript.

Repository outline:
- The 'Data' directory includes the necessary files for:

    * alpha and beta diversity plots, Indicator Analyses and Boosted Regression Tree analyses
    * summarizing data, and calculating statistics for the paper.
- The 'KO comparison' directory includes the necessary files for:
    * the comparative analysis between the KEGG Orthologs (KO) predictions from PICRUSt2 and the KOs profiled from corresponding shotgun metagenomes (MGS).
- The 'Shotgun_MGS' directory details the shotgun MGS workflow and the links to the SqueezeMeta pipeline https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta
- The 'PICRUSt2_input_files' directory includes the necessary files and script for the PICRUSt2 analyses
