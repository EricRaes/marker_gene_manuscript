# marker_gene_manuscript

Manuscript repository for: "Metabolic pathways inferred from a bacterial marker gene illuminate ecological changes across South Pacific frontal boundaries" Nature Communications

This repository contains the scripts and key datafiles used in our manuscript.

Repository outline:
- The 'data' directory includes the necessary files for:
    * re-generating the manuscript figures related to the PICRUSt2 predictions.
    * covering alpha and beta diversity, indicator analyses and Boosted Regression Tree analyses
    * summarizing data, and calculating statistics for the paper.
- The 'KO comparision' directory includes the necessary files for:
    * the comparative analysis between the KEGG Orthologs (KO) predictions from PICRUSt2 and the KOs profiled from corresponding shotgun metagenomes (MGS).
- The 'shotgun MGS' directory details the shotgun MGS workflow and the links to the SqueezeMeta pipeline https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta
- Please note that the code for the PICRUSt2 analyses are not in this repository but can be found here https://github.com/picrust/picrust2 instead. The input file for the PICRUSt2 analyses can be found in the data directory folder
